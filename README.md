# WordCounter

## Description

WordCounter is a DHTML2 web system made for the purpose of gathering the amount of 'err' and 'hum' said by the Dr. Sarah Berdini (CS1840 lecturer at Royal Holloway University of London).
And saving in logs the data with the times as well as knowing the statistical data such as err per seconds, err per minutes, ...

## Usage

To use that system, just open the wordCounter.html page and either click on the buttons corresponding to the word she currently said or clicking on the _e_ key for err or _h_ key for hum.
